# Web-Design-Challenge

The analysis was all done in IRAF, SExtactor, and Excel. This is some work I did for Pine Mountain Observatory near Bend, Oregon. The GALEX space telescope had recently uncovered a new classification of galaxies called Extended Ultraviolet (XUV) Disk galaxies. We did some observations of galaxies in the Johnson U-band to see if XUV disks appeared differently in ground-based observations.

I have included one raw image, of NGC 2403. I show in this website some of the data products produced along the way in the analysis. 

I included a table generated from a .csv I created summarizing various measurements, as well as catalog quantities from the Third Reference Catalog of Bright Galaxies. Email me if you are interested in reading the full write-up. This work was funded by NASA's Oregon Space Grant Consortium.
